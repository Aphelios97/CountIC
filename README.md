# CountIC:Efficient Hypergraph Motifs Counting Algorithm Based on Hyperwedge Features
Code for the paper "CountIC:Efficient Hypergraph Motifs Counting Algorithm Based on Hyperwedge Features".  
The real-world datasets can be queried from [Cornell Hypergraph Dataset](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/)  
You can run demo with any dataset.  
To run HCA,type 'run_CountIC.sh Inclusion'.  
To run HIA,type 'run_CountIC.sh Intersection'.  
To run CountIC,type 'run_CountIC.sh'.
